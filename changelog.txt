----0.0.3----
-it's now possible to "select" autocomplete value with both the tab and confirm button
-corrected bug when clicking with right mouse to drag an editor element
-corrected bug with scrollable list #0 corruption when switching from "editor" to "standard" overlapping interaction
-solved network bug that in certain circumstances allowed the client send queue to "get stucked" and don't send anything to the server
-when you reload the assets the server will send only changed files, this should allows the creative team to iterate much more quickly now.


-----0.0.2-----
-created link to the executable in the game folder, so that now you don't have to navigate to the client folder to launch the game.
-changelog.txt and readme.txt are now included at the root of the game folder.
-corrected a bug with the "mountain rock", they are now "real" rocks. (their Z scale was too low before).
-now when the program crashes a pop-up will be shown and the game will produce a dump in the errors folder. Please send all the files present in the errors folder back to the developer, you will help him a lot :)
